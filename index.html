    <h1>Pereyra Perspective</h1>
    <p>by Julian Pereyra</p>

    <p>Hey! Welcome to my site!</p>
    <p>I am a college student currently studying Computer Science and Film! I like think that you can have your cake AND eat it too!</p>
    <P>I hope to provide software that delivers experiences that are out of this world and capture photos and videos that speak to the soul.</p>
    <div><div>
    <p>On this site you'll see a gallery of photos I take with my camera! Thrilling, right?</p>
    <p>I currently use a Canon EOS Rebel T3i to capture and Adobe Lightroom to develop.</p>
    <p>With the knowledge I currently have, I set this website up myself!</p>
    <p>I currently utilize GitHub's hosting service they offer for free, but plans are made to switch to a more stable service eventually.</p>
    <div>
    <p>Hope you enjoy! :)</p>
