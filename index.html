        <p>I'm a college student studying Computer Science and Film! This site is created and maintained by me and all the photos you see are taken by me!</p>
        <p>This project was mainly created as a way to start building a portfolio of pictures! I finally got the chance to obtain a professional
        camera this past year and I wanted a reason to go out and take pictures with it. I mainly focus on areas and things I find interesting while
        also trying to capture a certain feel with all the pictures I take, and I hope you can feel that same feeling.</p>
