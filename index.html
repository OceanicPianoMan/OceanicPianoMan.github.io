    <h1>Pereyra Perspective</h1>
    <p>by Julian Pereyra</p>

    <p>Hey! Welcome to my site!</p>
    <p>I am a college student currently studying Computer Science and Film! I like think that you can have your cake AND
        eat it too!</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>On this site you'll see a gallery of photos I take with my camera! Thrilling, right?</p>
            <p>I currently use a Canon EOS Rebel T3i to capture and Adobe Lightroom to develop.</p>
            <p>With the knowledge I currently have, I set this website up myself!</p>
            <p>I currently utilize GitHub's hosting service they offer for free, but plans are made to switch to a more
                stable service eventually.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Hope you enjoy! :)</p>
